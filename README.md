# Solo-maintainer Typst template

[![CI](../../actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE) [![Citation](https://img.shields.io/badge/citation-CFF-blue.svg)](CITATION.cff)

A Typst 0.15 baseline with checksum-verified formatting, immutable CI, and structural PDF verification.

## Status

This repository is designed for one maintainer. Automated checks are required;
no second reviewer, CODEOWNERS approval, team membership, or mandatory human
approval is introduced.

## Start here

1. Replace the title and author in `main.typ`.
2. Run `make verify`.
3. Review the generated PDF before creating a release tag.

## Development

CI enforces Typstyle formatting, compiles fail-closed, and validates the generated PDF with qpdf, pdfinfo, and non-empty text extraction.

## Versioning

`typst.toml` is authoritative for a packaged template; otherwise release tags are authoritative. Citation metadata must not duplicate an unmanaged version.

## Logging

Runtime logging is not applicable to a typesetting-only repository; compiler logs are retained as CI evidence.

## Security

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); do not disclose credentials or sensitive source data
in a public issue.

## Citation

See [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff). Release-specific versions and identifiers are
added only when the release exists.
